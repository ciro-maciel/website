This is an interesting opportunity for me.

Would you be able to share some additional information with me? I'm happy to sign an NDA if you like.

Generally, access to partnermetrics.io and/or a copy of the payouts.csv would be really useful (please don't forget to remove customer emails). I can do my own analysis from there.

Other questions:
- What's the growth rate looking like?
- What's the churn looking like?
- Do you have anything on the roadmap that customers want that you haven't yet released?
- What are the top 3 customer support queries about?
- What's the tech stack?
- Who would be staying? The support staff are external I'm guessing?
- Do you see any revenue expansion at all (customers upgrading from one paid plan to a higher paid plan)?

Lastly, I can say I'd be willing to explore a strong offer provided you're open to a small cash balance component, typically not more than 20% (paid over no longer than 12 months usually).

Let me know if there's any interest!

A neat trick is to simply insert the name of the app and its competitors into the App Library.

That will show what kind of messaging resonates the most with the end-customer, and the disparity between the product in-question and competitors.

It will also indicate if paid spend is being oriented into this niche, which is a positive indicator that paid ad spend can be a profitable way to buy MRR.


Kickoff most quant analysis on Google. I search the product, look at the results, get an idea of what other keywords the product ranks for, and what the competitors of those keywords are.

Try to get a general sense of what the authority of the product is relative to the rest of its ecosystem.

My investment focus in Shopify apps, and those tend to get most of their user acquisition from the App Store.

Plug in both the app store listing as well as their .com address, if there is one — some products successfully utilize content to drive demand.
