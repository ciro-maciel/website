**C37 - CNC** [#](https://c37.co/)

A company from São Paulo - BRA, formed in 2011 with the objective of designing domestic CNC machine tools and making the technologies of the means of production available to all people, giving them autonomy to create their own products in a personalized and unique way.

The story about my professional development and improvement I will tell in the blog. Now I will start the organization and unification of all the projects.

**Style Guide** [#](http://style.ciro-maciel.me/)

Working to create a better Style Guide for C37 products, after 3 versions, with different technologies and approaches:
 
 - [less](https://github.com/ciro-maciel/style-guide/tree/v1) - v1
 - [scss](https://github.com/ciro-maciel/style-guide/tree/v2) - v2
 - [react app](https://github.com/ciro-maciel/style-guide/tree/v3) - v3

I realized that I could create something similar to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), with my characteristics and needs, so I came to [api first/storybook/react components](https://github.com/ciro-maciel/style-guide/tree/v4) - v4


**Brain** [#](https://brain.ciro-maciel.me/)

For over 15 years I have the need and I imagine putting all the measurable activities of my life into a system. It was a very different time today.

Brain is another attempt to put my needs into practice.
